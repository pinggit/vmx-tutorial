Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a virtualization infrastructure for the
Linux kernel that turns it into a hypervisor. It has been gaining industry
traction and market share in a wide variety of software deployments in just a
few short years. KVM turns to be a very interesting virtualization topic and is
well positioned for the future.

Juniper MX86(VMX: Virtual MX) is a virtual version of the MX Series 3D
Universal Edge Router that is installed on an industry-standard x86 server
running a Linux operating system, applicable third-party software, and the KVM
hypervisor. It is one of industry-level implementations of router based on KVM
technology.

== about This document :

This document records some of my learning and testing notes about KVM/MX86 and
related technologies. Current it contains:

//* commands in this doc does not require: 
//+
//--
//  ** ILO/console access of the server (except initial bios setup, if necessary)
//  ** root password
//--
//+
//however it requires sudo priviledge to run root level commands

* illustration of various installation procedures
* illustration of verification procedure
* illustration of features involved in VMX installation process, mostly from
  KVM/virtualization technology's perspecive 
* some case studies

This doc can be used as a reference when you: 

* read the official VMX documents, use this as an "accompanying" doc for better
  understanding to the materials
* need a quick list or "cheatsheet" kind of commands to when verifing a feature
  or troubleshooting an issue
* when running into issues, need a "working example" as a reference

== format of this doc

following format is available to read/download:

* HTML:                 vmx-tutorial.html
* PDF:                  vmx-tutorial.pdf
* asciidoc(pure text)   vmx-tutorial.adoc

== future update

As things changes along and as I accumulated more practical usages cases/issues
from the fields/discussions/lab tests, I may update this doc periodically
whenever I feel there is a need.

The html file will always be the most up-to-date version. PDF version will be
generated whenever big changes were made.

== a "TODO" list:

There are a lot of relevant contents that I haven't put into this doc. I'll add
more topics whenever I find more time and accumulated enough resources and test
cases.

* breakdown of qemu command parameters
//* customerization of the installation script to make it startup friendly
* libvirt API scripting
* Intel DPDK
* NUMA
* KSM
* Intel EPT/AMD
* HyperThreading(HT)
* internal stuff (flow cache, junos troubleshooting, internal packet flow, etc)
* troubleshooting KVM/VMX
